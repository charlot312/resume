My name is Antoine Chartrand-Deniger, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration with specializations in Applied Economics, Finance, and Mathematics at HEC Montreal, aiming to complete my degree by April 2025. Alongside, I am enriching my analytical prowess with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Montreal. My educational foundation is built upon a Diploma of College Studies in Pure and Applied Sciences, reflecting my strong inclination towards quantitative and analytical disciplines. My academic pursuits are driven by a passion for delving deep into complex economic and financial systems, and I am continually seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge in practical settings.
